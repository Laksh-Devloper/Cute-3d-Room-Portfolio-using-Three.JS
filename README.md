# 💜 Cute 3D Room Portfolio (Three.js) 💜

This repository contains the source code for my **Cute 3D Room Portfolio**, built using **Three.js + Vite**.  
It’s an interactive, playful, room-style portfolio inspired by modern 3D web experiences and customized with my own assets, models, and tweaks.

If you’re curious about building a portfolio like this — beginner friendly chaos included — this project is a great starting point ✨
